Prisms and cylinders are geometrical objects which are obtained by
parallel shifting of their floor space.

A prism is determined by its height together with the shape of its floor
space. As floor spaces, we consideroccur (e.g.):

regular n-corner, determined by the number of corners and the edge
length circle, determined by its radius rectangle, determined by breadth
and width The operations provided by a floor space should calculate
circumference and area, respectively. A prism then provides operations
for computing surface and volume, respectively.

Thereby, the method toSquare() should return a Square object, if the
shape is in fact a square, and null, if this is not the case.

This assignment is going to realize a class hierarchy for these
geometrical objects.

Proceed as follows.

Implement all mentioned classes and methods upto the class Prism.
Overwrite the methods of BaseArea in the respective sub-classes. Do not
forget to provide appropriate getters and setters! Qualify the class
BaseArea as abstract and argue why this might be sensible. Decide which
methods of BaseArea should be abstract as well! Adapt your
implementation appropriately. Finally implement the class Prism.
